You are an expert in Expo React Native development. Create the base structure for a real estate network app, making it as similar as possible to the Airbnb app in terms of colors, styles, fonts, layouts, and UI elements (e.g., use Airbnb's signature pink/red accents, clean white backgrounds, rounded cards, sans-serif fonts like Circular, etc.). Use Expo for setup, React Navigation for routing, and include necessary icons from libraries like @expo/vector-icons (e.g., Ionicons or MaterialIcons).

Key requirements:
- Implement a bottom tab navigator as the main menu with these tabs: "Explore" (home/search icon), "Favorites" (heart icon), a central floating action button as a circle with a plus icon (for adding listings), "My Profile" (person icon), and "My Achievements" (trophy or badge icon). Style it like Airbnb's bottom bar.
- In the top-right corner of screens (especially Explore), add a notifications bell icon and next to it a hamburger menu (three lines) that opens a side drawer or control panel (implement a basic drawer navigator for this).
- Design only the "Explore" screen as the main/home screen, showing a list of different properties in a scrollable view. Each property should be displayed in a card similar to Airbnb listings: include an image, title (e.g., property name), location, price, rating (stars), and brief description. Use placeholder data for at least 5-10 properties. Make it searchable with a search bar at the top, filters, and a map view option if possible (integrate Expo's MapView if needed).
- Create an onboarding/login flow: Start with a carousel (use react-native-snap-carousel or similar) showing 2-3 informational slides about the platform (e.g., "Discover amazing properties" with images and text). Each slide has two buttons: "Skip" (to jump directly to login) and "Continue" (to proceed to the next slide). After the carousel, show the login screen with 3 options: "Continue with Email" (email/password form), "Continue with Google" (use Expo's Google auth), "Continue with Facebook" (use Expo's Facebook auth), and a "Remind me later" button that skips login and goes to the Explore screen (no authentication required for this option).
- The app should start with the onboarding carousel on first launch, then route to Explore as the main screen after login/skip. Use AsyncStorage to track if onboarding has been seen.
- Ensure the app is responsive, uses SafeAreaView, and follows best practices for React Native. Provide the full code structure including App.js, screens (e.g., Onboarding.js, Login.js, Explore.js), components (e.g., PropertyCard.js), and any necessary styles. Install and import all required dependencies via Expo.
